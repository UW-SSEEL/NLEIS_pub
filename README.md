LabView codes to perform an nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (NLEIS) experiment.

## Documentation
NLEIS is an extension of the more commonly known electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. In our doc folder you will find:

1. **NLEIS Introduction.pdf** provides the most basic information about EIS and NLEIS. Also available on the [web](https://www.cei.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/EIS-and-NLEIS-Wiki.pdf), courtesy of Brian Gerwe and Clean Energy Institute.
2. **NLEIS Starting Guide.pdf** provides instructions to perform an NLEIS experiment with our LabView code with an accompanying example of a diode circuit.

## Patent Information:
Our NLEIS experiment method is patented under:

Adler, Stuart B., Wilson, Jamie R., Huff, Shawn L., and Schwartz, Daniel T., *Method for conducting nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.* United States.
